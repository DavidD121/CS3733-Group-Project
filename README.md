# Software Engineering Group Project

This project was completed for CS3733, Software Engineering, at WPI. My team consisted of Jon Aronoff, David Danielian, and Travis Thompson. We built the web application using Amazon Web Services. Jon and Travis focused on the front end development (HTML/CSS, JS, and API Gateway), and David and I focused on backend development (Java/Lambda functions, databases, API Gateway). For this project, I specifically developed the way to create a "choice" (ie a decision that a team makes, what is your favorite flavor of ice cream?), like and dislike one of the answers to the choice (ie an answer could be chocolate, or strawberry), and adding feedback to an answer. The code I wrote was in Java.
